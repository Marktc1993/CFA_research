    "\n",
    "In the forward pass, you will take many filters and convolve them on the input. Each 'convolution' gives you a 2D matrix output. You will then stack these outputs to get a 3D volume: \n",

    "**Exercise**: Implement the function below to convolve the filters W on an input activation A_prev. This function takes as input A_prev, the activations output by the previous layer (for a batch of m inputs), F filters/weights denoted by W, and a bias vector denoted by b, where each filter has its own (single) bias. Finally you also have access to the hyperparameters dictionary which contains the stride and the padding. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: \n",
    "1. To select a 2x2 slice at the upper left corner of a matrix \"a_prev\" (shape (5,5,3)), you would do:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a_slice_prev = a_prev[0:2,0:2,:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will be useful when you will define `a_slice_prev` below, using the `start/end` indexes you will define.\n",
    "2. To define a_slice you will need to first define its corners `vert_start`, `vert_end`, `horiz_start` and `horiz_end`. This figure may be helpful for you to find how each of the corner can be defined using h, w, f and s in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder**:\n",
    "The formulas relating the output shape of the convolution to the input shape is:\n",
    "$$ n_H = \\lfloor \\frac{n_{H_{prev}} - f + 2 \\times pad}{stride} \\rfloor +1 $$\n",
    "$$ n_W = \\lfloor \\frac{n_{W_{prev}} - f + 2 \\times pad}{stride} \\rfloor +1 $$\n",
    "$$ n_C = \\text{number of filters used in the convolution}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we won't worry about vectorization, and will just implement everything with for-loops."
